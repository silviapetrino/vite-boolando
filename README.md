# vite-boolando

- Create a new project using Vite and Vue 3, and define the necessary components to structure the layout. 

- Use the same markup as the Boolando exercise already implemented, organizing styles with SCSS. 

- Once the macroblock structure is ready, populate the menu items dynamically using the component's data.
